# pseudo-MRI-engine
Pseudo-MRI engine for MRI-free electromagnetic source imaging.
It utilizes the head shape digitization points, generally acquired during MEG/EEG acquisition, for warping a given MRI template to the best fit to the subject's head. It yields a set of robustly warped MRI and its derivative surfaces, referred to as pseudo-MRI. Although the dense and evenly sampled scalp digitization points are recommended, the software can efficiently generate pseudo-MRI even with as few as 25 points (nearly 1 point per 25 cm2).

Please stay tuned; more details will come after the publication...
